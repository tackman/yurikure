# Yuri-Kure rule book

## Story

You will be an "Atmosphere" to introduce and couple your desired girls.
Girls are in the first grade in a school. Watch the changing relationships in 9 terms.

## Game overview

In Yuri-Kure, your aim is that your desired Girl Pair will become the Fated Couple.
Players assign Support Points to their desired Girl Pair in secret.
Each player's Control Points of each girl will depend on their assigned Support Points.
You can gain control of girl's Actions by **exposing your control points**.
When your desired Girl Pair becomes a Fated Couple, you are close to victory.
Or, Yuri Polygamy with three or more girls may also bring victory for players unsatisfied by a single girl-girl pair.

## Components

## Setup

## Set up initial couple and initial Favors

At the beginning of a game...

1. A Girl Pair become a couple
   - Place a Couple Marker between the Girl Pair, with the "Before Kiss of Promise" side (the blue side) faceup.
1. A Girl Pair start with Favor Level 2
1. Two Girl Pairs start with Favor Level 1

Choose each of these Girl Pairs using a random method, such as drawing two face down girl tokens.

Note:

- The same Girl Pair cannot receive starting Favor more than once. So Girl Pairs cannot start with Favor Level 3 or 4 by overlapping 2 and 3, or Favor Level 2 by gaining Favor Level 1 twice.
- The starting couple may also receive a starting Favour increase.

## Generate girls Action Order

1st ~ 7th on the game board shows the girls Action Order. Set up the Action Order randomly, by placing girls tokens face down for example.

## Deciding players' Support Points

Players write their Support Points on the Support Point Sheet **after the initial game state is settled. You can refer to the initial game state when you decide Support Points.**

### About Support Point assignment

Each player chooses five Girl Pairs in secret, then writes down different 1 ~ 5 point values for the five Girl Pairs.
These values are Support Points. Each value expresses how much the player pushes a Girl Pair.
Higher values mean higher support for this Girl Pair.
You must not use the same value more than once, and the total Support Points will add up to 15.
As an advanced rule, you may give the same Girl Pair Support Points more than once during setup. For example, if you give Akane-Sorai 5 Support Points, you may also give them 4 Support Points for a total of 9.

```plaintext
When playing for the first time, it is recommended to only allow Support Points to be given to the same Girl Pair once.
```

All Support Points decided here will be hidden until the game ends.

### Calculating Control Points

Each player's Control Points effect the girls (not a Girl Pair, Control Points exist per girl).
You are able to control the girl's Actions with your Control Points.
Control Points are worked out from each player's Support Points automatically.
These values are calculated by the following rule:

#### Any girl's Control Points = Sum of Support Points for Girl Pairs including the girl

```plaintext
Example:
Player A assigns 3 Support Points to "Aakane / Shirakaba", and 2 to "Shirakaba / Kuroki".
Here,
Control Points of Akane = 3
Control Points of Shirakaba = 3 + 2 = 5
Control Points of Kuroki = 2
```

```plaintext
You can declare you have Control Points for a girl in the Action Phase (described below). Exposure of Control Points is explained in Turns and Action Phases.
```

### Additional Support Points

Players gain additional Support Points at the following times.

- 1 additional point at the end of the 3rd turn
- 3 additional points at the end of the 6th turn

You can assign these points to any Girl Pairs whether you supported them during setup, or not.
You may assign 6th turn additional points one by one. In other words, you can do all the following assignments:
3 points to a Girl Pair, 2 points to a Girl Pair and 1 point to another Girl Pair, 1 point each to three different Girl Pairs.
**After Support Points are added, Control Points also increase according to assigned Support Points.**

## Turns

A "Turn" is a cycle of game progress. A turn contains the following three phases.

1. Action Phase

   - Girls perform an "Action" (described below) in the Action Order in this phase.
   - All interventions from players to girls are done in this phase.

1. Couples Phase

   - Processing updates to the couples.

1. Kiss of Promise Phase

   - Coupled Girl Pairs attempt a Kiss of Promise. The game end condition is also checked in this phase.

When the game end condition is satisfied in the Kiss of Promise Phase, the turn ends **immediately** and proceeds to winner determination.

```plaintext
An immediate turn end may affect when Fated Couples and Yuri Polygamy are satisifed at the same time.
```

The game lasts for up to 9 turns. When the 9th turn ends, the game proceeds to winner determination.

## Action Phase

Each girl's action is determined in the Action Phase. Players can reveal some or all of their Control Points to choose a girl's action.
Girl's actions are performed in the Action Order. Action Order is chosen in setup.
Action is one of: "Approach", "Confession", "Game of Love", or "Nothing".

### Reveal of Control Points

Players may reveal _some_ or _all_ Control Points for a target girl to gain control.
You can reveal up to the number of Control Points you have.
You can reveal your control at any time in the Action Phase.
When you reveal your Control Points for a girl whose control has already been taken by another player, you need reveal more (NOT EQUAL) Control Points.

Example: Player A has 7 hidden Control Points over Murafuji. Nobody has revealed Control Points over Murafuji, so Player A reveals 1 Control Point to Murafuji and declares Murafuji will Approach Kuroki.
Here, before the action is completed, Player B interrupts to reveal 2 Control Points to Murafuji, then declares her action will be a Confession to Midorino.
Player A has more (hidden) Control Points over Murafuji, so he reveals 4 Control Points to Murafuji and declares Approach to Kuroki again.
No other player reveals more Control Points for Murafuji, therefore Murafuji's action is to Approach Kuroki.

```plaintext
Above is a simplified rule about revealing Control Points. More strict (but complex) rules are provided on our website. Applying strict rules is recommended if all players are expert.
```

### Actions

#### Approach

Approach raises the Favor level between the approaching girl and the approached girl.
The Approach action is declared, along with the target (approached) girl. Raise the Favor level by 1 for the pair.

If the approaching / approached girl is part of a couple, and is approaching a girl other than the coupled girl / approached by a girl other than the coupled girl, raise Discomfort level by 1 for the pair(s).

Favor level and Discomfort level are counted separately. For example, when the Discomfort level increases for a pair with Favor level 4, the Favor level will NOT be decreased to 3, but the pair will have BOTH Favor level 4 and Discomfort level 1.

Favor levels and Discomfort levels are expressed by Favor/Discomfort tokens placed between the girls.

#### Confession

Two girls become a couple in this action. **Only a girl who is not in a couple with any other girl can make a Confession.**
Confession is declared along with a target girl.

1. The confessed to girl chooses "OK" to become a couple, or "No" to reject. When a target girl chooses "OK", the confessing and confessed to Girl Pair becomes a couple, then the action ends.

   - The confessed to girl's choice is decided by the player who has control over her. Other players may interrupt to change the girl's choice by revealing their Control Points.
   - If no player reveals Control Points for the confessed to girl, the girl will choose "No".

1. When the confessed to girl chooses "No", the result is determined by the roll of a dice.
   - If the rolled number is less than or equal to Favor level, this Girl Pair will become a couple (even though the confessed to girl said "No".)
   - If the rolled number is greater than the Favor level, they will not become a couple, and the Favor level increases by 1 between them.

Whether the confessed to girl chooses "OK" or "No", every couple the confessing / confessed to girls are a part of increase their Discomfort level by 1 if a new couple is formed.

If a new couple forms, place the Couple Marker between them with the "Before Kiss of Promise" side (the blue side) faceup.
Even if a newly formed couple has been a couple before, they will start from "Before Kiss of Promise" again.

```plaintext
A girl who is already part of a couple may be confessed to by other girls. This may cause so-called two-timing.
```

#### Game of Love

This action is a Game of Love, played by the girls. You need to declare a Game of Love along with the target Girl Pair. The target Girl Pair must not already be a couple (a girl in the target Girl Pair may be part of a couple with another girl).

The other girls with vote on whether the target Girl Pair should become a couple.

1. Other girls vote "Agree" or "Disagree" on the target Girl Pair.
   - Choice of vote is decided by the player who has control over the girl.
   - When a girl is not taken control of by any player, she will vote "Disagree".
   - The girl who is making the Game of Love action automatically votes "Agree".

Girls vote in the Action Order. The first girl to vote is the girl after the girl performing the Game of Love action, in the Action Order.
When the last girl in the Action Order votes, voting continues to the 1st girl so that every girl (except the target Girl Pair) can vote.

- If a majority vote "Disagree", nothing will happen.
- If a majority vote "Agree", the following will happen.
  1. Each target girl chooses whether they will become a couple or not. This is done in Action Order.
  1. If BOTH target girls chose "OK", they will become a couple, in the same way as during the Confession action.
  1. If EITHER of the target girls chooses "No", Discomfort level increases by 1 between the target girls.

#### Do nothing

A girl takes no action. If no player reveals Control Points for a girl, she will automatically choose Do Nothing.

When all girls complete their action, proceed to the next phase.

## Couples Phase

Roll a dice for each couple. The effect is determined by the result of "(Dice number) - (Discomfort level)".

- 0 or less: The couple breaks up (the Girl Pair will move to the not-a-couple state)
- 1 ~ 2: Raise Discomfort level by 1
- 3 or more: No effect
- If the dice number is 6, do not perform the above actions, and raise Favor level by 1.

```plaintext
Rolling 6 on the dice is an exceptional case, not affected by the score of "(Dice number) - (Discomfort level)".
```

After the above process, couples with Discomfort level 6 break up. Broken up Girl Pair's Favor and Discomfort level is reset to 0.

Then, each Girl Pair with Favor level 6 become couples. This "natural forming" will not cause any increase of Discomfort level between themselves and any couples they are already a part of.

## Kiss of Promise Phase and victory condition

Roll a dice to determine whether each couple succeeds in the Kiss of Promise or not. They will succeed when "(Dice number) + (Favor level) - (Discomfort level)" is 4 or more.

The initial couple (determined in setup) does not try it in the 1st turn.

A succeeded couple moves to the "first time succeeded" state (expressed by the red side of the Couple Marker). A failed couple moves to the "Not succeeded" state (expressed by the blue side of the Couple Marker).
If a "first time succeeded" couple fails the Kiss of Promise, the state will move back to "Not succeeded".

If a "first time succeeded" couple succeeds the Kiss of Promise again, the couple will become a Fated Couple and the game ends.
When multiple couples exist, all attempted Kiss of Promise are treated as simultaneous. This means multiple Fated Couples may be born in one game.

```plaintext
The Kiss of Promise must succeed for two consecutive turns for a couple to become a Fated Couple. Success, failure and then success does not cause a couple to become a Fated Couple.
```

When a Fated Couple is born, the winner is determined by the sum of Support Points for the Fated Couple(s).
If players have the same sum of Support Points, a player who revealed **FEWER** Control Points for the Fated Couple(s) is the winner.
If revealed Control Points are also the same, the game is a draw.

```plaintext
Example: Shirakaba and Midorino become a Fated Couple. Player A and Player B both assigned 4 Support Points to Shirakaba-Midorino and this is the highest number of Support Points for this couple.
Player A has revealed 3 Control Points to Shirakaba and 4 Control Points to Midorino.
Player B has revealed 1 Control Point to Shirakaba and 5 Control Points to Midorino.
The sum of revealed Control Points is; A is 7, B is 6. So the winner is Player B.
```

## Yuri Polygamy to end the game

When no Fated Couple is born in the Kiss of Promise Phase, check if Yuri Polygamy has formed. Yuri Polygamy means "In a group of 3 or more girls, all Girl Pairs in the group are couples".

```plaintext
Example 1: When Akane and Shirakaba, Shirakaba and Kuroki, Kuroki and Akane are couples, Akane-Shirakaba-Kuroki's Yuri Polygamy is formed.
Example 2: When Sorai and Midorino, Midorino and Tsuge are couples and Sorai and Tsuge are not a couple, Sorai-Midorino-Tsuge is not a Yuri Polygamy.
Example 3: Murafuji and Akane, Murafuji and Kuroki, Murafuji and Shirakaba, Akane and Kuroki, Akane and Shirakaba, Kuroki and Shirakaba are couples, Murafuji-Akane-Kuroki-Shirakaba forms Yuri Polygamy.

Note that already-coupled girls cannot confess to any other girl. Yuri Polygamy cannot be formed only by Confessions.
```

When Yuri Polygamy is formed, the game ends and proceeds to winner determination. The winner is determined by the sum of Support Points assigned to the Girl Pairs included in the Yuri Polygamy group.
Tie-breaking is also determined by revealed Control Points, the same as in the Fated Couples case. The player with fewer revealed Control Points is the winner.

## Game end by 9th turn

When neither a Fated Couple nor Yuri Polygamy are born by the end of the 9th turn, the winner is determined by existing couple(s). Count Support Points (and Control Points to tie-break), the same as the Fated Couples case.

## Misc rules

- Max Favor / Discomfort level is 6.
- If you are short of Favor level tokens or other components, continue the game as though you did have these components. The game should not be affected by constraints from physical components.

## FAQ

- In the 1st turn, another Girl Pair (not an initial couple settled in setup) become a couple. Does this couple try the Kiss of Promise in the 1st turn?

  - Yes, they try. Only the initial couple formed at setup does not try Kiss of Promise on the 1st turn. The initial couple also tries the Kiss of Promise like other couples after the 1st turn.
